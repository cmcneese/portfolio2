                  Day 1 of class was engaging, challenging and all around really fun. After being assigned our first homework assignment, I began getting a feel of what this new endeavour would entail. Learning how to focus in on small sections at a time, not letting the size of the whole project overwhelm me. I learned the importance of taking little steps forward. As long as I was moving forward, I was making progress.

                  We were given an assignment of a website that had already been built, it was our job to search through the code and find all of the syntax errors and fix them. As fun as that may sound for some, including me, also stumped me many times too. I stuck with it and learned many things along the way. One key character trait I was reminded of was persistence, and to never ever give up. I knew it would be a challenge going in. This was what I had signed up for.

                  After surviving Week 1 of class and assignments, the T-shirts assignment was probably one of the more intimidating assignments. I was already struggling with FlexBox, so this was bound to get my practice in. This is a sentence about my struggles and wins.

                  After learning how to tackle pages with multiple boxes, taking it one step at a time and learning how to break down the page into containers, this task didn't seem quite as daunting. This sentence is about how I overcame this obstacle and am now a successful Junior Developer.

                  Surf & Paddle was our next biggest assignment that came the closest to a full-page layout, involving a few more elements. Having practice with this assignment gave me the confidence to explore more layout options for personal blog. The elements of building the page around a "hero-like" captivating image, followed by an article-like blog, with profile picture off-centered, to the right.

                  This assignment was challenging, yet very rewarding especially when I saw it all slowly taking shape. This helped me build the confidence to keep on trying, to not give up, and never ever quit. I was very thankful for this assignment, as well as my teacher and very supportive staff.

                  I am very thankful for this assignment of creating a portfolio site. Although this may not be my ideal layout, it still covers many aspects of good design, in the sense of being responsive, having simple colors and having a good mix of photos, text and layout as to not be too boring.

                  I learned so much in the first two weeks of these assignments and classes. Although my mind was being overloaded, I was doing my best to soak it all up like a sponge.
